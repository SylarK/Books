#   open(filename, mode)
#   modes:  'r' - read only
#           'w' - for only writing (an existing file with the sam name will be erased)
#           'a' - open the file for appending ( any data is automatically added to the end)
#           'r+'- opens the file for both reading and writing 

#           It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. 
#           The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, 
#           even if an exception is raised at some point.

#   If youâ€™re not using the with keyword, then you should call f.close()
